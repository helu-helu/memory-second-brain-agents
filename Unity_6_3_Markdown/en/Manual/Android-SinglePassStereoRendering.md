# Single-pass stereo rendering for Android

Unity supports [single-pass stereo rendering](SinglePassInstancing.html) for Android devices that support multiview. Multiview consists of the [GL\_OVR\_multiview2](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/OVR/OVR_multiview2.txt) and [GL\_OVR\_multiview\_multisampled\_render\_to\_texture](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/OVR/OVR_multiview_multisampled_render_to_texture.txt) OpenGL ES extensions. These extensions require **shaders**A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#shader) to use a 2D texture array that consists of two slices, one slice per eye.

## Shader code requirements

To use single-pass stereo rendering with custom shaders, you may need to include additional shader code. You don’t need to include additional code if your custom shaders are:

* **Surface Shaders**A streamlined way of writing shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline. [More info](SL-SurfaceShaders.html)  
  See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SurfaceShader) that don’t have custom vertex processing.
* Fixed-function pipeline shaders.

**Note**: These shader changes are compatible with multi-pass stereo rendering.

### Modify your shaders

If you want to use the `unity_StereoEyeIndex` built-in shader variable to know which eye the GPU is rendering to, you must declare `UNITY_VERTEX_OUTPUT_STEREO` in any shader stage output structs that you have. For example:

```
struct v2f {
    float2 uv : TEXCOOR0;
    float4 vertex : SV_POSITION;
    UNITY_VERTEX_OUTPUT_STEREO
};
```

To initialize the output data, use `UNITY_INITIALIZE_VERTEX_OUTPUT_STEREO()` in the **vertex shader**A program that runs on each vertex of a 3D model when the model is being rendered. [More info](writing-shader-writing-shader-programs-hlsl.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#vertexshader) function. For example:

```
v2f vert (appdata v)
{
    v2f o;
    UNITY_INITIALIZE_VERTEX_OUTPUT_STEREO(o);
    o.vertex = UnityObjectToClipPos(v.vertex);
    o.uv = TRANSFORM_TEX(v.uv, _MainTex);
    return o;
}
```

To initialize `unity_StereoEyeIndex` in subsequent stages, add `UNITY_SETUP_STEREO_EYE_INDEX_POST_VERTEX()` at the beginning. For example:

```
fixed4 frag (v2f i) : SV_Target
{
    UNITY_SETUP_STEREO_EYE_INDEX_POST_VERTEX(i);
    // sample the texture
    fixed4 col = tex2D(_MainTex, i.uv);
    // apply fog
    UNITY_APPLY_FOG(i.fogCoord, col);
    return col;
}
```

If your shaders use other shader stages, use the `UNITY_TRANSFER_VERTEX_OUTPUT_STEREO()` macro to transfer the eye index to the subsequent stages.

**Tip**: To calculate the final position of the object, it’s best practice to use `UnityObjectToClipPos(IN.vertex)` instead of `mul(UNITY_MATRIX_MVP, IN.vertex)`.

## Post-Processing Shaders

You must update **post-processing**A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More info](PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing, postprocess  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#post-processing) shaders to deal with the eye textures being a 2D texture array. To help with this, Unity includes the `UNITY_DECLARE_SCREENSPACE_TEXTURE()` macro. To make textures work in both multi-pass and single-pass modes, wrap each textures in this macro. Also, when you sample the texture, use the `UNITY_SAMPLE_SCREENSPACE_TEXTURE()` macro.

This macro requires that you call `UNITY_SETUP_STEREO_EYE_INDEX_POST_VERTEX()` beforehand when in single-pass mode. Unity also includes similar macros for depth textures and screen space shadow maps. You can see the full list at the bottom of `HLSLSupport.cginc`.
