# Use numeric field expressions

Numeric field inputs accept:

* Positive and negative numbers. Some properties might limit the range. For example, RGB values can’t be negative.
* Mathematical expressions.
* Special functions for multiple selections.

## Use mathematical expressions

You can use a mathematical expression to calculate the value of a numeric field.

For example, if you enter `2+3`, the field calculates the value `5` and uses it. When you change focus away from the field, the field refreshes and shows the calculated value.

For more information about supported expressions, refer to [`ExpressionEvaluator`](../ScriptReference/ExpressionEvaluator.html).

## Use special functions

You can use special functions to edit multiple selected objects at once. For example, a linear ramp can distribute the selected objects along an axis.

**Note**: Constrain Proportions Scale doesn’t support math mathematical for multi-selection.

### Linear

For a linear ramp between `a` and `b`, use `L(a,b)`.

![The X field has the value L(-10,10). The selected capsules are evenly distributed along the x-axis from -10 to 10.](../uploads/Main/inspector-expr-L.png)


The X field has the value `L(-10,10)`. The selected capsules are evenly distributed along the x-axis from `-10` to `10`.

### Random

For random values between `a` and `b`, use `R(a,b)`.

![The X field has the value R(-10,10). The selected capsules are placed at random intervals along the x-axis from -10 to 10](../uploads/Main/inspector-expr-R.png)

### Assign

To modify the current values, use the `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` expressions. For example, to double the field’s value for all selected objects, enter `*=2`.

![The X field has the value /=3, which divides the randomised values from the previous example by three.](../uploads/Main/inspector-expr-assign.png)


The X field has the value `/=3`, which divides the randomised values from the previous example by three.

## Combine expressions

You can use mathematical expressions in function. For example, the expression `L(0,2*pi)` produces a linear distribution of values between `0` and `2pi`.

The following examples uses the linear ramp function as the argument in sine and cosine functions in the X and Z fields. This distributes the objects in a circle:

![This circle was created by using cos(L(0,2*pi))*5 for X and sin(L(0,2*pi))*5 for Z.](../uploads/Main/inspector-expr-trig.png)


This circle was created by using `cos(L(0,2*pi))*5` for X and `sin(L(0,2*pi))*5` for Z.

## Use expressions in custom editors

When you create [custom editors](editor-CustomEditors.html), support for numeric expressions are automatically available in all [`EditorGUI.PropertyField`](../ScriptReference/EditorGUI.PropertyField.html) and [`EditorGUILayout.PropertyField`](../ScriptReference/EditorGUILayout.PropertyField.html) properties that have a numerical value.
