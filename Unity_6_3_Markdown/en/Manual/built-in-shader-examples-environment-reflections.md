A cat-like character with a metallic surface that reflects the scene.

Often **Normal Maps**A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#normalmap) are used to create additional detail on objects, without creating additional geometry. Let’s see how to make a **shader**A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#shader) that reflects the environment, with a normal map texture.

Now the math is starting to get *really involved*, so we’ll do it in a few steps. In the shader above, the reflection
direction was computed per-vertex (in the vertex shader), and the fragment shader was only doing the reflection
probe **cubemap**A collection of six square textures that can represent the reflections in an environment or the skybox drawn behind your geometry. The six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left, right, forward and back). [More info](class-Cubemap-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Cubemap) lookup. However once we start using normal maps, the surface normal itself needs to be calculated on a per-pixel basis, which means we also have to compute how the environment is reflected per-pixel!

We’ll have to learn a new thing now too; the so-called “tangent space”. Normal map textures are most often expressed in a coordinate space that can be thought of as “following the surface” of the model. In our shader, we will need to to know the tangent space basis vectors, read the normal vector from the texture, transform it into world space, and then do all the math
from the above shader. Let’s get to it!

```

    Properties {
        // normal map texture on the material,
        // default to dummy "flat surface" normalmap

    }

                // these three vectors will hold a 3x3 rotation matrix
                // that transforms from tangent to world space
                half3 tspace0 : TEXCOORD1; // tangent.x, bitangent.x, normal.x
                half3 tspace1 : TEXCOORD2; // tangent.y, bitangent.y, normal.y

            // vertex shader now also needs a per-vertex tangent vector.
            // in Unity tangents are 4D vectors, with the .w component used to

                half tangentSign = tangent.w * unity_WorldTransformParams.w;
                half3 wBitangent = cross(wNormal, wTangent) * tangentSign;

Phew, that was quite involved. But look, normal mapped reflections!
